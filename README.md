- [Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/export-to-data-lake)
- [SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-link/sql-synapse-link-overview)

In this workshop you will learn about the main concepts related to Azure Synapse Link and how it can be used to implement a modern data platform architecture. You will learn how Azure Synapse Link you can leverage to establish a solid data platform to quickly ingest, process and visualize data from a Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database data sources. The reference architecture you will build as part of this exercise will provide you a great level of details.

In the exercises in this lab you will build a end to end scenarios using sample data. The workshop was designed to progressively implement a modern data platform architecture.

**Keep in mind**

# Rever esses bullets points

- The reference architecture proposed in this workshop aims to explain just enough of the role of each of the Azure Data Services included in the overall modern data platform architecture. This workshop does not replace the need of in-depth training on each Azure service covered.

- The services covered in this course are only a subset of a much larger family of Azure services. Similar outcomes can be achieved by leveraging other services and/or features not covered by this workshop. Specific business requirements may require the use of different services or features not included in this workshop.

- Some concepts presented in this course can be quite complex and you may need to seek more information from different sources to compliment your understanding of the Azure services covered.
